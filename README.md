👋 Hi there, I’m Jen McGregor!

📖 I've always been a natural storyteller - thriving in English writing, creative copywriting, and public speaking. 

📈 To tap into my passion for mathematics and analytical thinking, I obtained a **M.S. in Business Analytics at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo** - my goal being to creatively employ data to tell stories.  

🤝 My goal is to help companies make decisions based on the intersection of their data with consumer choices, marketing campaigns, and people + talent operations. 

☑️ With a B.S. in Business Administration with concentrations in Marketing and Accounting, I am able to distill technical material into actionable insights for key enterprise stakeholders.   

My skillset includes:

- **Languages**: SQL (MySQL), R (ggplot2, dplyr, caret)
- **Softwares**: RStudio, MySQL, Tableau, Orange, SPSS, JIRA/Confluence, Excel, PowerPoint, Asana, Hubspot, Adobe Illustrator.

Outside of work, you can find me reading, working out, writing, or watching Survivor!
