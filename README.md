- 👋 Hi there, I’m Jen McGregor!

I've always been a natural storyteller - thriving in English writing, creative copywriting, and public speaking. 

To tap into my passion for mathematics and analytical thinking, I pursued a MS in Business Analytics at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo - my goal being to creatively employ data to tell stories.  

My goal is to help companies make decisions based on the intersection of their data with consumer choices, marketing campaigns, and people + talent operations. 

With a BS in Business Administration with concentrations in Marketing and Accounting, I am able to distill technical material into actionable insights for key enterprise stakeholders.   

My skillset includes:

Languages: SQL (MySQL), R (ggplot2, dplyr, caret)
Software: RStudio, MySQL, Tableau, JIRA/Confluence, Excel, PowerPoint, Asana, Hubspot, Adobe Illustrator,
